# Description

This repository documents the implementation of a **campus network topology** that connects three main buildings: **ICT Building**, **CSE Department**, and **Math Department**. The project demonstrates **network design**, **configuration**, and **testing** using routers, servers, and workstations.

## 🖧 Network Topology  

The network consists of the following core components:  
- **🏢 Three Buildings**: ICT Building, CSE Department, and Math Department.  
- **📡 Three Routers**: Router 1, Router 2, and Router 3 interconnecting the buildings.  
- **💾 Servers**:  
  - **DHCP Server**: Handles dynamic IP address allocation.  
  - **DNS Server**: Resolves domain names.  
  - **Web Server**: Hosts a simple website.  

### 📋 IP Addressing  
- **Building LANs**:  
  - ICT Building: `192.168.1.0/24`  
  - CSE Department: `192.168.2.0/24`  
  - Math Department: `192.168.3.0/24`  
- **Inter-Router Links**:  
  - Router 1 ↔ Router 2: `10.10.0.0/30`  
  - Router 2 ↔ Router 3: `20.0.0.0/30`

## ⚙️ Configuration Highlights  

### 🌐 Static IPs  
Static IPs are assigned to routers and servers to ensure stable communication:  
- **Router 1**:  
  - ICT LAN: `192.168.1.1`  
  - Inter-router Link: `10.10.0.1`  
- **💾 DHCP Server**: `192.168.1.2`  
- **🌎 DNS Server**: `192.168.1.3`  
- **🌐 Web Server**: `192.168.1.4`  

### 📥 DHCP Configuration  
Three address pools are defined for dynamic IP allocation:  
1. **🏢 Pool 1 (ICT Building)**:  
   - Default Gateway: `192.168.1.1`  
   - IP Range: Starting at `192.168.1.5`  
   - Maximum Users: 20  
2. **🏢 Pool 2 (CSE Department)**:  
   - Default Gateway: `192.168.2.1`  
   - IP Range: Starting at `192.168.2.2`  
   - Maximum Users: 20  
3. **🏢 Pool 3 (Math Department)**:  
   - Default Gateway: `192.168.3.1`  
   - IP Range: Starting at `192.168.3.2`  
   - Maximum Users: 20  

### 🌎 DNS Configuration  
- The **DNS Server** resolves the domain `www.tahir.com` to the IP address `192.168.1.3`.  

### 🌐 Web Server Configuration  
- Both **HTTP** and **HTTPS** services are enabled.  
- A custom index page is served at `www.tahir.com`.  

### 🔁 Routing Information Protocol (RIP)  
RIP is configured on all three routers to enable communication across the network:  
- **Router 1**: Routes for `192.168.1.0` and `10.10.0.0`.  
- **Router 2**: Routes for `192.168.2.0`, `10.10.0.0`, and `20.0.0.0`.  
- **Router 3**: Routes for `192.168.3.0` and `20.0.0.0`.

## 🎯 Demonstration  

### 🖧 Network Connectivity  
- Successful communication between:  
  - **ICT Building ↔ CSE Department**  
  - **ICT Building ↔ Math Department**  

### 🌐 Web Server Access  
- Verified accessibility of `www.tahir.com` from all PCs in the network:  
  - **ICT Building**  
  - **CSE Department**  
  - **Math Department**

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a reliable campus network with efficient IP management, inter-department communication, and web services. The combination of static IP configurations and dynamic IP allocation ensures stability and scalability.
